> Speak, and it becomes text — an offline speech-to-text tool that keeps your files on your machine.

**拾音 (shiyin)** is a fully local, offline audio/video-to-text tool powered by [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp). Your audio files **never leave your computer** — everything runs on-device, ideal for meeting recordings, lecture notes, and interviews where privacy matters.

- **100% local**: server listens on `127.0.0.1` only; files and models never leave your machine
- **Web UI**: double-click to launch, use in browser; needs Node.js 18+
- **Three outputs**: txt / srt / vtt — switch and edit inline, saved instantly
- **Subtitle follow-along**: built-in player + clickable subtitle lines with precise seeking
- **Free model choice**: fast / balanced / high-accuracy models, one-click download & switch

## ❓ FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Page won't open? | Install Node.js 18+; run `启动拾音.bat`; visit `http://127.0.0.1:18900` |
| Transcription slow? | Local CPU runs ~2–4× realtime (20–30s for 60s audio) — normal; try small model or VAD |
| Browser shows old icon? | Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5); re-pin/unpin PWA; re-run `安装到桌面.bat` |
| Supported formats? | Common audio/video (wav/mp3/m4a/flac/mp4/mkv/avi…); 16kHz mono WAV skips transcoding |
| Does it go online? | Only to download models (hf-mirror.com); transcription is fully offline |
